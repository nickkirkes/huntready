## Active Blockers

None. E01 audit (commit `6318614`) found no blocking issues. One open documentation-debt item: architecture.md prose says "every entity carries `confidence`" but interfaces only place it on `RegulationRecord` and `VerbatimRule` — should be corrected when next touched. Not an implementation blocker.

## Next Actions

- Begin E02 planning (Montana geometry ingestion) — run `/plan-next-epic` to draft the epic file and run the E02 validation triad
- Architecture.md prose corrections (confidence scope) when next touched
